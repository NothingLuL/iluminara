Symbolism of the Lighthouse
    In "The Lighthouse," the lighthouse represents **forbidden knowledge**, similar to Prometheus' fire or the divine light
    in mythology. Robert Pattinson's character's obsession with reaching the light symbolizes his desire for power and
    wisdom, but his outcome suggests that there is a price to pay for challenging the divine.

Duality and Power Struggle
    The characters of Dafoe and Pattinson embody a struggle between authority and rebellion, similar to the relationship
    between gods and humans in Greek myths. Thomas Wake (Dafoe) is like Poseidon or Proteus, a guardian of the sea and
    tradition, while Winslow (Pattinson) represents the rebellious youth, doomed by his ambition.

The Cycle of Madness
    The film repeats images and situations, reinforcing the idea of an infinite cycle, much like the eternal punishment of
    Sisyphus. The repetition of tasks and Wake's transformation into a monstrous figure emphasize the feeling that the
    lighthouse is a mental prison.

Homoeroticism and Repression
    The tension between the characters carries a repressed homoerotic charge, reflecting loneliness and toxic masculinity.
    The forced proximity and the love-hate relationship between them suggest an internal struggle against forbidden desires.

The Use of Black and White
    The monochromatic palette highlights the contrast between light and shadow, reinforcing the theme of duality. It also
    recalls German Expressionist cinema, where distorted shadows reflect unstable mental states.

The Meaning of the Ending
    The final shot, with Winslow being devoured by seagulls, echoes the myth of Prometheus, punished for stealing fire from
    the gods. This suggests that defying the forbidden leads to self-destruction.
