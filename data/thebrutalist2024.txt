Symbolism of Brutalist Architecture
    The architectural brutalism in the film represents the harshness of the immigrant's life and the
    struggle for survival in a hostile world. As László faces rejections and challenges, his own
    architectural creations reflect his emotional state: at first, they are ambitious, but over time, they
    become colder and more functional, losing their essence.

Duality between Art and Capitalism
    The film explores the clash between artistic integrity and the commercialization of art. László
    struggles to maintain his vision, but the demands of the market, represented by the character of
    Harrison Lee, force him to compromise his creativity. Over time, his work adapts to the rules of
    capitalism, turning him into a shadow of what he used to be.

The Immigrant Experience
    László is a foreigner in a country that values his talent but marginalizes him as a person. His identity
    is in constant conflict: his accent and history separate him from the architectural elite, while his
    ambition distances him from his own roots. The film uses light and enclosed spaces to symbolize this
    exclusion and the process of adaptation.

Psychology of the Characters
    László's relationship with his wife is crucial to understanding his transformation. She symbolizes his
    humanity and his past, but as he becomes obsessed with his career, their relationship deteriorates. His
    story reflects how ambition can become a prison, distancing him from the people and values that
    initially gave him strength.

Metaphor of the Creative Process
    Architecture becomes a reflection of the creative process and personal sacrifice. In the final scene,
    László observes a skyscraper under construction: an imposing structure, yet still unfinished. This image
    summarizes his life, marked by the search for perfection, but always with something missing, a piece he
    can never complete.
